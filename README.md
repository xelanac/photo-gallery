# Photo Gallery with editing
A native android photo gallery implemented in *Kotlin*. With this app you can:
* Take a picture;
* Delete it or save it in the gallery;
* Edit a picture (texts, stickers, change colors of stickers/texts);
* Save it into the official gallery of device/google photos;

You can see that in photo detail fragment, in addition to the modification, there is another tool shown in bottom-left of the picture: a *compass*.
This one was developed using two different sensors: 
* Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER;
* Sensor.TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD;

# Library used:
* "CameraX" for take a picture;
* "Glide" for photos' management/images loading;
* "PhotoEditor" by *burhanrashid52* (https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor)... great one!!! üëèüèø
